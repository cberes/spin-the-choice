            <p>
                Somes games let you spin a wheel. Some games give you a choice. You take that choice, and you spin it. The name of the game is Spin the Choice!
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is pretty straightforward.
                You can choose to spin or you can choose to choose.
                If you choose to spin, you can land on:
            </p>    
            <ul>
                <li>Spin</li>
                <li>Choice</li>
                <li>Lose a spin</li>
                <li>Lose a choice</li>
                <li>Free spin</li>
                <li>Free choice</li>
                <li>Spin again</li>
                <li>Prize wheel</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These are the possible outcomes on the game wheel.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also a prize wheel. You can spin the prize wheel when you land on <strong>Prize wheel</strong> on the game wheel.
                The prize wheel contains these outcomes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Free spin</li>
                <li>Winnebago</li>
                <li>Free choice</li>
                <li>Washer dryer</li>
                <li>Mazda</li>
                <li>Microwave oven</li>
                <li>Point bank</li>
                <li>Mercedes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                That's about everything that we know of <em>Spin the Choice</em> according to Peggy Hill. (We also know you can lose.)
                We have had to make up some rules to fill in the holes.
                If you disagree with a rule or you have a suggestion, <a href="https://github.com/cberes/spin-the-choice/issues/new">open an issue</a> on GitHub.

            <h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
            <p>
                The objective is to score as many points as possible.
                You begin the game with 3 choices and 3 spins.
                The game ends when, at the conclusion of a turn, you have no spins remaining and choices remaining.
            </p>
            <h2 id="turn">Turn</h2>
            <p>
                At the beginning of a turn, you make a choice: to spin or to choose.
                You may choose to spin only if you have at least 1 spin remaining.
                You may choose to choose only if you have at least 1 choice remaining.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following your choice, you must spin the game wheel.
                If you chose to spin, then deduct 1 spin from your spins remaining.
                If you chose to choose, then deduct 1 choice from your choices remaining.
                At this point, the turn has ended unless you landed on <strong>Prize wheel</strong>.
                If you landed on <strong>Prize wheel</strong>, then you must spin the prize wheel.
                After spinning the prize wheel, your turn has ended.

                You must spin the game wheel after making your choice.
                Each outcome on the game wheel has unique consequences.
            </p>
            <h4>Spin</h4>
            <p>
                If you land on Spin after choosing <strong>Spin</strong>, then you earn 100 points.
                If you land on Spin after choosing <strong>Choice</strong>, then you lose 100 points.
            </p>
            <h4>Choice</h4>
            <p>

            </p>
            <h4>Lose a spin</h4>
            <p>
                You lose 1 spin. You cannot have fewer than zero spins remaining.
            </p>
            <h4>Lose a choice</h4>
            <p>
                You lose 1 choice. You cannot have fewer than zero choices remaining.
            </p>
            <h4>Free spin</h4>
            <p>
                You gain 1 spin.
            </p>
            <h4>Free choice</h4>
            <p>
                You gain 1 choice.
            </p>
            <h4>Spin again</h4>
            <p>
                If you chose <strong>Choice</strong>, then you gain 1 choice.
                If you chose <strong>Spin</strong>, then you gain 1 spin.
                You must use this spin or choice immediately.
            </p>
            <h4>Prize wheel</h4>
            <p>
                You must spin the prize wheel. A cow bell sounds.
            </p>

            <h2 id="prize-wheel">Prize wheel</h2>
            <p>
                You must spin the prize wheel after landing on <strong>Prize wheel</strong> on the game wheel.
                There are eight possible outcomes. Most of the outcomes award you a prize. (Note: no outcome awards you a <em>real</em> prize.)
                These such prizes have a corresponding value in points.
                The exceptions to this type of prize are described below.
            </p>
            <h4>Free spin</h4>
            <p>
                You gain 1 spin.
            </p>
            <h4>Free choice</h4>
            <p>
                You gain 1 choice.
            </p>
            <h4>Point bank</h4>
            <p>
                The amount of points in the point bank is added to your point total. Then, the point bank is reset to zero.
                After every spin of the game wheel, 10 points are added to the bank. The point bank does not reset at the end of the game.
                (But the bank will reset if you close your browser or refresh the page.)
